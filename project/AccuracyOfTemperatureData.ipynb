    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation of the study was to investigate whether the temperature data from the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) could be replaced with the Open-Meteo (OpM) data that are computationally easier to retrieve. In this pilot, I focus on developing the methods that can be applied in a more detailed investigation using a longer timespan and a greater number of localities.\n",

    "The FMI data were manually retrieved on 8 February, 2024, using the web interface at [https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations). The chosen measurement was 'Average temperature' under 'Hourly observations' within 'Weather observations'. The chosen timespan was '1.1.2024-31.1.2024' and the chosen observation stations were 'Helsinki Malmi airfield' and 'Helsinki Vuosaari harbour'. The observations were downloaded in 'CSV format' and are placed in the directory `data/`.\n",
